*Foswiki 1.2.0 and later only*

This is the modern implementation of the classic Foswiki RCS based store. It has been moved into a contrib as other store implementations have emerged, and the RCS store's status as "the one and only" store implementation has been eroded.

---++ Managing Topics
The =Trash= web should be be cleared periodically, by archiving (saving) the text and RCS files if required (recommended), then deleting them from the =pub/Trash= and =data/Trash= directories. 

<blockquote class="foswikiHelp">%X% This can only be done from on the server, not through the browser. %T% Be sure to recreate the empty !TrashAttachments after you remove it.

%T% Since simple FTP access to the ==Trash== directory is all that is required for maintenance, it is possible to grant =Trash= admin privileges to multiple users, while strictly limiting server access.</blockquote>
